# Game Design document

In the following document, if you used a particular game design pattern in a section, please describe it (a brief description will do) and how you used it. Code snippets may help with this.
In addition to this outline, I have an example of short design document from Richard McKenna titled: "Spiked Acid Game Design Document", which helped inform this document.

## Introduction
* See "Spiked Acid Game Design Document"


## Technology
* Which platform(s)?
* Game engine/software library (obviously SFML plus framework plus your own additions and external libraries - describe them all in a general fashion).


## Backstory
* If you want to get creative - knock yourselves out...


## Objective
* Describe overall game objective - e.g. what must your character do to survive, win? How will your character get damaged/die


## Gameplay
- Describe how your game works in general - see the "Spiked Acid Game Design Document"

## Levels
* Describe the levels.
* Did you use procedurally generated levels?
    - if so how?


## Controls
* Mouse and or keyboard (other controller)
    - how was it implemented
- Controls
- List keys and what they do?
- Did you implement a control pattern?


## GUI/In-game menu
* Is there a splash screen?
* E.g. New game, pause game etc.
* If you used/implemented a GUI, describe the library you used (whether it was used in tile editor and/or main game e.g. title menu/networking management etc.)
* Is there a countdown or transition to main game (while not necessarily a GUI issue - it's worthwhile mentioning it somewhere)


## Artwork
* Describe the artwork used and source/origin of the artwork
* Describe how you implemented and managed the textures (was memory management techniques used)


## Sound (sound effects)
* Describe how sound is implemented and managed using SFML
* Describe what sound effects your game has


## Music
* Describe the music used and its source/origin
* Is there a menu track, and a track for main game (level).
* Is the music randomly chosen for each game.
